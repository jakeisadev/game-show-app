# game-show-app
A Team Treehouse Project where I use my JavaScript skills to build a fully interactive app by working with the DOM.

In this project, I had to break it down step by step to really understand how to complete it.

Going from generating a random number, to getting the correct phrase to display, checking letters for accuracy, checking for wins/losses, and finally resetting the game upon hitting "try again" or "start game", I was challenged to think about how to implement each step.

I felt most confident initializing a random number and getting the phrase to display on screen. Even though I ran into multiple bugs, I've gotten enough experience so far to be able to successfully problem solve with enough patience, and see those issues through. It was gratifying to see the DOM working howe I imagined it to work in my head and also in the mock up that was provided to me.

I had trouble with checking for wins/losses plus re-initializing the game upon one of those cases. It wasn't that I didn't know which variables to call when, it was more, logically, when do I initialize what?

For example, with re-initializing, it took me awhile to realize the best sequence to reset everything. Also, it took me quite a bit to realize that I had to add a delay at the end of the game so the animations could finish.
